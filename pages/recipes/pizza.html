        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
            <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven) </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar </li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3> Directions</h3>\

            <ol>
             <li><h3><strong>the yeast:</strong></h3></li>

                <p>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer.
                 Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</p>
                 <p>After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely.
                 The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.</p>
                 <p>(Note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", 
                    no proofing is required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)</p>
