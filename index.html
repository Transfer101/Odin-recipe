                <h2>About ME</h2>
                <p> Hello, my name is Abdul Ahad Durrani and I currently am 17 years old, I wish to become an Automotive Service Technicians through an apprenticeship that will  benefit me alot.</p>
                <p>I have tons of work experience so that not a problem and my skills and knowledge in this trade even surpass other level one, two, and three technicians. With my knowledge of vehicle maintenance I make the technicians works easier while also solving the dreaded problem many dealers face which is the problem of costumer wait times. it's as simple as that, fast work = reduced costumer wait times.</p>
                <p>I am originally from Pakistan and I fell in love with this trade in grade 9 when i took my first class in transportation technology.</p>
                <p>i coded this website to help those who read my resume get answers for questions they may have, not everything is stated here you get the idea, the main and important things are stated here.</p>

                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <p>If my resume and cover letter have not fully went over my experience and knowledge in this trade then here I shall explain on that.</p>
                <p>Lets hop right in, below are a bunch of my experiences in trade and what I have done regarding this trade</p>
                <ul class="list-of-experience">
                    <li>4 years of every single Automotive course available in high school</li>
                    <li>Level one at Centennial College</li>

            <div class="card Certificate">
                <h2>Certificates/ Acheivments</h2>
                <p>Some people have marks to show their dedication and hardwork, some people have references that show their dedication and hardwork. but what about me? I personally have references from previous jobs aswell as Certificates. Certificates can't be forged and can only show the truth while marks are a scam and serve no real purpose and references can lie to you. I am not saying that  those are useless but come on certificates speak for themselves. So let me tell you about my certificates (so far).</p>
                <ul class="certificates">
                    <li>SHSM red seal- explained before.</li>

                    <li>Ontario Scholar - Acheiving amazing marks in high school</li>
                    <li>Dual Credit Scholarship - taking a college level course while in high school</li>
                    <li>A Bunch of Course certificates- I have gotten certificates for many courses which naming is not benefit but rather it is mentioned in my resume</li>
                </ul>
